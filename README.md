code and data needed to reproduce figures, tables, and supplementary web material for Roberson et al (submitted Sep 2023). Data are confidential and no data that identifies individual fishing locations, vessels, or fishing activities (e.g. sets) can be made public. Code/data for Figure 2 and WebFigure 2 not included here because reproduction of the maps requires geographic coordinates of individual fishing events.
